	<p>Our work in emergency preparedness focusses on supporting countries to build core public health and health system capacities that reduce the health risks and consequences of all types of emergencies.</p>

	<p>All countries face risks and potential health threats from an increasing range of hazards, including infectious diseases, chemical and radio nuclear incidents, food contamination, and threats associated with climate change including extreme weather events and deforestation.

	<p>Risk factors, including poverty, gender, age, migration, health and nutritional status, displacement, unplanned urbanization, increase people’s exposure and vulnerability to these threats and hazards.</p>

	<p>WHO supports Member States to evaluate, develop and strengthen core capacities laid out in the International Health Regulations, to detect, assess, notify and report events and to respond promptly and effectively to public health emergencies.</p>

<h3  style="font-size: 20px;">Readiness</h3>

<p>Countries, communities and organizations must be able to respond immediately and effectively to potential health threats and emergencies caused by any hazard.  For this, readiness is essential. Readiness is the interface between longer-term preparedness actions and immediate response to emergencies. These actions should aim to build, improve and sustain the operational capabilities of countries, WHO and partners to respond to risks to public health, and ensure sustained capacity on the ground.</p>

Immediately after WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern,
 WHO offices in countries, territories and areas globally swiftly repurposed their operations to provide 
 relevant guidance and support to hosting governments in designing and implementing sustainable
  interventions that contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, ensure uninterrupted provision 
  of essential health services, save lives and protect the vulnerable. Below case studies
   illustrate different aspects of WHO response to COVID-19 in countries, territories and
    areas and focus on successful interventions but also highlight ongoing challenges and
	 represent the experience of a diverse range of countries, each with different population
	  health needs, health system development, and levels resources.</P>
